# Architecture Decision Records

**Navigation:** Start with `docs/architecture/ARCHITECTURE-MASTER-INDEX.md`. This file governs ADR process only and does not create an alternative project path.

## Purpose

This directory contains the formal record of approved, rejected, and superseded architectural decisions.

## Mandatory rule

An ADR is required before changing an architectural invariant, ownership boundary, dependency direction, Futures-only boundary, Linear/Inverse semantics, exchange isolation, quality floor, pipeline ordering, fail-closed behavior, or release criteria.

A proposal is not approval.

## Status lifecycle

PROPOSED → APPROVED → implemented and verified

or

PROPOSED → REJECTED

An approved decision may later become SUPERSEDED only through another explicit architecture decision.

## Owner-request rule

The project owner may propose an architecture change.

If the proposal conflicts with an invariant, implementation must stop and issue:

CRITICAL ARCHITECTURE WARNING

The warning must explain the conflict, impact, risk, alternatives, and affected gates/contracts.

Owner intent does not authorize bypassing architecture governance.

## Minimum ADR structure

Every ADR must contain:
1. Status
2. Date
3. Proposer/Owner
4. Problem
5. Current Architecture
6. Proposed Change
7. Why Current Architecture Is Insufficient
8. Alternatives Considered
9. Affected Invariants
10. Affected Contracts
11. Affected Dependencies
12. Affected Tests/Gates
13. Risk Analysis
14. Migration Plan
15. Rollback Plan
16. Explicit Approval/Reconfirmation

## No silent architecture drift

No AI, agent, engineer, CI job, or implementation pressure may convert a proposed architecture change directly into code.

Required path:

PROPOSAL → WARNING → IMPACT ANALYSIS → ADR → EXPLICIT RECONFIRMATION → DOCUMENT UPDATE → IMPLEMENTATION → TEST → CI → SAME-SHA VERIFICATION

## Phase 1 implementation note — multiplier contract

The multiplier/contract-specification implementation does not change an architectural invariant or ownership boundary; it implements the already-approved Phase 1 contract. Its fixed semantic baseline is documented in the authoritative architecture documents and enforced by production contract tests and CI.

If a future change proposes different Linear/Inverse multiplier meaning, different financial formulas, different ownership, or different dependency direction, it becomes an Architecture Change Candidate and must use the ADR process above.

## Phase 1 multiplier closure

The multiplier/contract-specification implementation is a closed implementation of the approved architecture baseline and is evidenced by same-SHA CI. The Phase 1 cursor now advances to settlement asset and settlement semantics. Any future semantic change to multiplier meaning remains subject to the ADR process.
\n## Phase 1 settlement closure rule

Settlement asset and settlement semantics are an approved implementation of the existing Phase 1 contract baseline, not an architecture change. Any proposal to redefine settlement denomination, conversion direction, ownership, dependency direction, or fail-closed semantics must use the ADR process before implementation.
\n## Phase 1 settlement closure

Settlement asset and settlement semantics are a closed implementation of the approved Phase 1 baseline and are evidenced by same-SHA CI. The Phase 1 cursor now advances to margin asset and margin semantics. Any future semantic change to settlement denomination or conversion meaning remains subject to the ADR process.


## Phase 1 margin closure rule

Margin asset and margin semantics are an approved implementation of the existing Phase 1 contract baseline, not an architecture change. The canonical instrument identity already owns an explicit margin asset; this unit closes its denomination and conversion semantics without redefining leverage, initial/maintenance margin, liquidation, or exchange-specific collateral policy.

Any future proposal to redefine margin-asset ownership, equate margin with settlement, change conversion direction, introduce hidden defaults, alter dependency direction, or change fail-closed behavior is an Architecture Change Candidate and must use the ADR process before implementation.


## Phase 1 margin closure

Margin asset and margin semantics are a closed implementation of the approved Phase 1 baseline and are evidenced by same-SHA CI on main merge SHA f2c30bf3da77f56b2dd2d9350af7bb1376f47797. The Phase 1 cursor now advances to leverage vocabulary and contract-level constraints. Any future semantic change to margin-asset ownership, denomination, conversion direction, or fail-closed behavior remains subject to the ADR process.


## Phase 1 leverage closure rule

Leverage vocabulary and contract-level constraints are closed on main with same-SHA evidence at merge SHA 9949bad3641cba8474027019360b5539974c13e2. The Phase 1 cursor now advances to initial margin semantics.

Any future semantic change to leverage unit or bound semantics remains subject to the ADR process.

## Phase 1 initial margin cursor rule

Initial-margin semantics are a closed implementation of the existing Phase 1 architecture baseline only after the explicit requirement-rate contract, exact Decimal calculation, meaningful tests, CI enforcement, and same-SHA evidence are present.

The approved semantic boundary is:
- initial-margin requirement rate is an explicit dimensionless RATIO;
- notional is an explicit positive finite Decimal supplied from canonical multiplier/contract-specification semantics;
- initial-margin ratio is an explicit positive finite Decimal;
- initial margin amount = notional × initial_margin_ratio;
- output retains the notional denomination;
- no implicit rounding, conversion, leverage inference, exchange defaults, account-state inference, or downstream risk/liquidation semantics;
- applicability is CRYPTO/FOREX/GOLD and Linear/Inverse.

Any future proposal to derive initial margin from leverage, redefine the ratio, change the formula, move ownership across dependency boundaries, introduce hidden defaults, or change fail-closed behavior is an Architecture Change Candidate and must use the ADR process before implementation.

## Phase 1 initial margin closure

Initial-margin semantics are closed on main with same-SHA evidence at merge SHA `4bf8eb7f54f08b372d0dd30efe1068e258aa1f8f`. The Phase 1 cursor now advances to maintenance margin semantics.

Any future semantic change to initial-margin ratio meaning, formula, denomination, ownership, or fail-closed behavior remains subject to the ADR process.

## Phase 1 maintenance margin cursor rule

Maintenance margin is the next authorized Phase 1 implementation unit. Before implementation, its ownership, formula inputs, denomination, precision, applicability, and tier/rate/amount semantics where applicable must be explicitly frozen.

Any proposal to redefine maintenance-margin ownership, introduce hidden exchange defaults, silently couple maintenance margin to leverage, change Linear/Inverse financial meaning, or move dependencies across architectural boundaries is an Architecture Change Candidate and must use the ADR process before implementation.


## Phase 1 maintenance margin semantic lock

Maintenance margin is an explicit Futures domain/contract requirement. It is distinct from leverage, initial margin, liquidation, risk policy, and exchange-specific collateral policy.

Frozen semantics:
- owner: Futures domain/contract boundary;
- unit: RATIO for the maintenance-margin requirement rate;
- numeric representation: exact finite Decimal;
- inputs: canonical Futures instrument identity, matching market, explicit positive finite notional, and explicit positive finite maintenance-margin ratio;
- formula: `maintenance_margin_amount = notional × maintenance_margin_ratio`;
- output denomination: identical to the explicit notional denomination;
- precision: exact Decimal multiplication with no implicit rounding or quantization;
- applicability: CRYPTO Futures, FOREX Futures, GOLD Futures; Linear and Inverse;
- the notional is consumed from canonical multiplier/contract-specification semantics and is not redefined here;
- exchange-specific tiers, rates, offsets, brackets, notional bands, or collateral rules are not guessed or silently defaulted by this canonical contract;
- no inference from leverage, initial margin, account state, liquidation, risk policy, exchange defaults, or position sizing;
- no network, exchange SDK, persistence, runtime configuration, clock, notification, or account mutation dependency;
- missing, invalid, zero, negative, non-finite, contradictory, unsupported, stale, or ambiguous critical terms fail closed;
- meaningful contract tests, CI enforcement, and same-SHA evidence are required before the cursor can advance.

Production boundary: `contracts/futures/maintenance_margin.py`.
Test boundary: `tests/contracts/test_maintenance_margin.py`.
CI boundary: `.github/workflows/phase1-domain-contracts.yml`.

The canonical implementation does not claim exchange-specific tier schedules. Such schedules may be mapped later through explicit exchange/infrastructure contracts only when their provenance, tier selection semantics, denomination, precision, freshness, and failure behavior are explicit.


## Phase 1 maintenance margin closure evidence

Maintenance-margin semantics are COMPLETE on main merge SHA `7f647c4105738d7dfe298b283841e3eaec6524a7`.

Evidence on the exact merge SHA:
- production boundary: `contracts/futures/maintenance_margin.py`;
- test boundary: `tests/contracts/test_maintenance_margin.py`;
- Phase 1 Domain Contracts CI: green;
- Architecture Invariants CI: green;
- G01 Dependency Architecture CI: green.

The frozen contract remains:
- explicit RATIO requirement rate;
- exact finite Decimal arithmetic;
- explicit positive finite notional and maintenance-margin ratio;
- deterministic `notional × maintenance_margin_ratio`;
- unchanged notional denomination;
- CRYPTO/FOREX/GOLD and Linear/Inverse coverage;
- no guessed exchange-specific tiers/rates/offsets;
- fail-closed invalid, ambiguous, stale, contradictory, unsupported, or missing critical terms;
- no threshold reduction, test weakening, skip/xfail, or dependency-boundary weakening.

The next authorized Phase 1 unit is **position side and position mode semantics**. No Phase 2+ production implementation is authorized before the preceding Phase 1 exit criteria are evidenced.


## Phase 1 position side / position mode semantic lock

Maintenance-margin semantics are closed. The next Phase 1 unit is position side and position mode semantics.

Frozen baseline:
- owner: Futures domain/contract boundary;
- position side vocabulary: explicit LONG or SHORT only;
- position mode vocabulary: explicit ONE_WAY or HEDGE only;
- both are immutable, exchange-independent boundary vocabulary;
- ONE_WAY means one net position side at a time; HEDGE permits independently addressed LONG and SHORT positions;
- BOTH, NET, Spot, or implicit third states are rejected by the canonical contract;
- mode and side must be explicitly supplied; neither may be inferred from exchange/account state, order payloads, leverage, margin, or strategy behavior;
- exact financial calculation is not performed by this vocabulary contract;
- applicable to CRYPTO Futures, FOREX Futures, and GOLD Futures, and to Linear and Inverse Futures;
- no network, exchange SDK, persistence, runtime configuration, clock, notification, or account mutation dependency;
- invalid, missing, contradictory, unsupported, or ambiguous values fail closed;
- exchange-specific mapping may translate external mode/side representations only at infrastructure boundaries and may not redefine canonical meaning;
- meaningful contract tests, CI enforcement, and same-SHA evidence are required before the cursor advances.

Production boundaries: contracts/futures/position_side.py, contracts/futures/position_mode.py.
Test boundary: tests/contracts/test_position_side_mode.py.
CI boundary: .github/workflows/phase1-domain-contracts.yml.


## Phase 1 position side / position mode closure evidence

- test boundary: `tests/contracts/test_position_side_mode.py`;
- Phase 1 Domain Contracts CI: green;

- G01 Dependency Architecture CI: green.

The frozen contract remains explicit LONG/SHORT side vocabulary and ONE_WAY/HEDGE mode semantics, with no exchange/account inference, no Spot semantics, no hidden defaults, and fail-closed invalid or ambiguous values.

The next authorized Phase 1 unit is **price, quantity, monetary units, denomination, precision, and rounding semantics**. No threshold reduction, test weakening, skip/xfail, or dependency-boundary weakening is permitted.


## Phase 1 next-unit semantic gate — price / quantity / monetary units

The next unit must first freeze one explicit primary owner and define:
1. price and quantity units;
2. monetary denomination and quote/base/settlement relationships;
3. exact numeric representation;
4. precision and rounding/quantization semantics;
5. Linear/Inverse applicability;
6. CRYPTO/FOREX/GOLD applicability;
7. interaction with the already-closed multiplier, settlement, margin, leverage, initial-margin, maintenance-margin, and position side/mode contracts without redefining them;
8. missing, invalid, contradictory, stale, unsupported, or ambiguous input behavior;
9. allowed and forbidden dependencies;
10. meaningful tests;
11. CI enforcement;
12. same-SHA evidence.

No exchange-specific precision, tick size, lot size, rounding mode, or default may be guessed into the canonical contract.


## Phase 1 price / quantity / monetary-unit semantic lock

Position side and position mode are complete on main merge SHA 6731c6c80d4d31c4bb180dbb2d343de76537971a. The active Phase 1 contract is price, quantity, monetary units, denomination, precision, and rounding semantics.

Frozen baseline:
- owner: Futures domain/contract boundary;
- price unit: QUOTE_PER_BASE — quote-asset units per one base-asset unit;
- quantity unit: CONTRACTS, consistent with the canonical multiplier contract;
- price denomination must equal the canonical Futures symbol quote asset;
- price and quantity are exact finite positive Decimal values; bool and binary float inputs are rejected;
- canonical precision policy is EXACT and canonical rounding policy is NONE: no implicit quantization or rounding occurs;
- exchange tick sizes, lot sizes, decimal-place limits, exchange-specific precision, and exchange rounding modes are not guessed or embedded here;
- applicable to CRYPTO/FOREX/GOLD and Linear/Inverse Futures;
- this contract does not redefine multiplier, settlement, margin, leverage, initial/maintenance margin, position side/mode, funding, PnL, liquidation, or execution rules;
- no network, exchange SDK, persistence, runtime configuration, clock, notification, or account mutation dependency;
- invalid, missing, contradictory, unsupported, non-finite, zero, negative, or ambiguous values fail closed;
- infrastructure may map exchange-specific precision/rounding metadata only after this canonical semantic boundary and may not redefine its meaning;
- meaningful tests, CI enforcement, and same-SHA evidence are required before the cursor advances.

Production boundary: contracts/futures/price_quantity.py.
Test boundary: tests/contracts/test_price_quantity.py.
CI boundary: .github/workflows/phase1-domain-contracts.yml.


## Phase 1 price / quantity / monetary-unit closure evidence

Price, quantity, monetary units, denomination, precision, and rounding semantics are COMPLETE on main merge SHA `13c8edef7a0553b1262f2487935e001ef5348aa7`.

Evidence on the exact merge SHA:

- test boundary: `tests/contracts/test_price_quantity.py`;
- Phase 1 Domain Contracts CI: green;
- Architecture Invariants CI: green;
- G01 Dependency Architecture CI: green.

The frozen contract is exact QUOTE_PER_BASE pricing, CONTRACTS quantity, explicit quote denomination, exact Decimal precision, and no implicit rounding/quantization. Exchange-specific tick/lot/precision/rounding rules remain outside the canonical contract.

The next authorized Phase 1 unit is **funding-rate value, interval, and funding calculation semantics**. No threshold reduction, test weakening, skip/xfail, or dependency-boundary weakening is permitted.


## Phase 1 next-unit semantic gate — funding rate

The next unit must first freeze one explicit owner and define:
1. funding-rate unit and sign convention;
2. funding interval and time semantics, including UTC boundary requirements;
3. calculation inputs and outputs and their denominations;
4. exact numeric representation and precision/rounding behavior;
5. Linear/Inverse applicability;
6. CRYPTO/FOREX/GOLD applicability;
7. interaction with multiplier, settlement, margin, leverage, initial/maintenance margin, price/quantity, and position side/mode without redefining them;
8. provenance/freshness and stale/unknown behavior where applicable;
9. allowed and forbidden dependencies;
10. meaningful tests;
11. CI enforcement;
12. same-SHA evidence.

No exchange-specific funding interval, rate source, sign convention, or rounding rule may be guessed into the canonical contract.


## Phase 1 funding semantic lock

The active Phase 1 unit is funding-rate value, interval, provenance/freshness, and funding calculation semantics. This is a canonical Futures domain/contract boundary, not an exchange implementation.

Frozen baseline:
- owner: Futures domain/contract boundary;
- funding-rate unit: explicit `INTERVAL_RATE`, a dimensionless rate applied to one explicit funding interval;
- sign convention: explicit project vocabulary `POSITIVE_LONG_PAYS`: positive funding makes the explicit LONG side the payer and SHORT the receiver; negative funding reverses payer/receiver;
- interval: explicit aware-UTC start and end with strictly positive duration; no default interval is inferred;
- calculation input: an explicit positive finite notional already supplied by the canonical financial boundary; this contract does not recompute multiplier, price, quantity, settlement, margin, or exposure;
- calculation output: a deterministic funding transfer in the explicit notional denomination; payment amount is `abs(notional × funding_rate)`;
- zero funding rate is valid semantic data and produces no transfer;
- exact finite Decimal representation is mandatory; bool, binary floating-point, non-finite, invalid, or ambiguous financial values fail closed; no implicit rounding or quantization is introduced;
- applicability: CRYPTO, FOREX, and GOLD Futures; Linear and Inverse contract families;
- provenance: a non-empty explicit rate source and UTC observation timestamp are mandatory;
- freshness: stale observations and invalid time ordering fail closed; freshness requires an explicit UTC `as_of` and positive `max_age`; no hidden clock or age threshold exists;
- position side is consumed from the already-closed canonical LONG/SHORT vocabulary; position mode is not redefined here;
- prior multiplier, settlement, margin, leverage, initial-margin, maintenance-margin, and price/quantity contracts are consumed without redefinition;
- exchange-specific funding interval, external sign conventions, rate sources, rounding rules, transport, SDK behavior, scheduler behavior, persistence, runtime configuration, account mutation, and payment execution are outside this canonical boundary;
- exchange adapters may normalize their external funding semantics into this canonical vocabulary only at the infrastructure boundary and may not silently redefine canonical meaning;
- production boundary: `contracts/futures/funding.py`;
- test boundary: `tests/contracts/funding_contract_test.py`;
- CI boundary: `.github/workflows/phase1-domain-contracts.yml`;
- meaningful tests, CI enforcement, and same-SHA evidence are mandatory before the Phase 1 cursor may advance;
- no threshold reduction, test weakening, skip/xfail, guessed exchange behavior, or dependency-boundary weakening is permitted.


## Phase 1 funding closure evidence

Funding-rate value, interval, provenance/freshness, and funding calculation semantics are COMPLETE on main merge SHA `1744bc33db9678cfbf9ef57a5a1bb7e15b3acbaa`.

Evidence on the exact merge SHA:
- production boundary: `contracts/futures/funding.py`;
- test boundary: `tests/contracts/funding_contract_test.py`;
- export boundary: `contracts/futures/__init__.py`;
- Phase 1 Domain Contracts CI: green;
- Architecture Invariants CI: green;
- G01 Dependency Architecture CI: green.

The frozen contract is explicit `INTERVAL_RATE` funding, canonical `POSITIVE_LONG_PAYS` sign semantics, explicit UTC interval, exact Decimal arithmetic, explicit provenance/freshness, deterministic denomination-preserving transfer semantics, valid zero-rate/no-transfer behavior, CRYPTO/FOREX/GOLD and Linear/Inverse applicability, and fail-closed invalid/stale/ambiguous critical state. Exchange-specific funding behavior remains outside the canonical domain boundary.

No threshold reduction, test weakening, skip/xfail, guessed exchange behavior, or dependency-boundary weakening was used.

The next authorized Phase 1 unit is **realized PnL and unrealized PnL semantics**.

## Phase 1 next-unit semantic gate — realized and unrealized PnL

Before implementation, the next unit must freeze one explicit owner and define:
1. realized versus unrealized PnL meaning and lifecycle boundary;
2. required inputs, outputs, units, and denominations;
3. Linear/Inverse formulas without collapsing their financial meaning;
4. CRYPTO/FOREX/GOLD applicability;
5. interaction with canonical instrument, multiplier, settlement, margin, leverage, price/quantity, funding, position side/mode, and accounting boundaries without redefining them;
6. exact numeric representation and precision/rounding behavior;
7. realized/unrealized state transition semantics and what events make PnL realized;
8. valuation/reference-price provenance and freshness where applicable;
9. invalid, missing, stale, contradictory, unsupported, or ambiguous state behavior;
10. allowed and forbidden dependencies;
11. meaningful tests and CI enforcement;
12. same-SHA evidence before the cursor advances.

No exchange-specific PnL formula, fee treatment, mark-price convention, settlement behavior, rounding rule, or accounting default may be guessed into the canonical contract.


## Phase 1 realized/unrealized PnL semantic lock

The active Phase 1 unit is realized PnL and unrealized PnL. This is a canonical Futures financial contract boundary and does not own execution, fees, funding transfers, settlement, liquidation, or account mutation.

Frozen baseline:
- owner: Futures domain/contract boundary;
- realized PnL is deterministic PnL for an explicit quantity of an existing position that is closed/offset by an explicit exit price;
- unrealized PnL is deterministic mark/reference-price PnL for an explicit still-open position quantity;
- Linear PnL denomination is QUOTE; formula before side sign is quantity × multiplier × (reference_price − entry_price);
- Inverse PnL denomination is BASE; formula before side sign is quantity × multiplier × (1 / entry_price − 1 / reference_price);
- LONG uses the formula sign directly; SHORT negates it;
- realized calculation uses the explicit closing/offsetting execution price; unrealized calculation uses an explicit valuation/reference price;
- quantity, multiplier, and prices are explicit positive finite exact Decimal values; bool and binary floating-point inputs are rejected;
- zero PnL is valid and is not treated as an error;
- no implicit rounding or quantization is introduced;
- unrealized valuation requires explicit non-empty provenance and an aware UTC observation timestamp; stale or time-inconsistent valuation fails closed when freshness is checked;
- freshness uses explicit UTC as_of and positive max_age; no hidden clock or age threshold is used;
- fees, commissions, funding transfers, settlement transfers, margin, leverage, liquidation, and accounting entries are not silently included in PnL;
- partial close/offset semantics are represented by the explicit quantity supplied to the contract; this contract does not invent position-state transitions;
- applicable to CRYPTO, FOREX, and GOLD Futures and Linear and Inverse contract families;
- prior instrument, multiplier, settlement, margin, leverage, position side/mode, price/quantity, and funding contracts are consumed without redefinition;
- execution infrastructure owns provenance of a realized closing execution; market/data infrastructure owns valuation-price sourcing; this contract consumes validated facts;
- no network, exchange SDK, persistence, runtime configuration, scheduler, account mutation, or exchange-specific mark-price/fee/accounting rule belongs here;
- exchange-specific PnL conventions must be normalized at the infrastructure boundary and may not silently redefine canonical formulas;
- production boundary: contracts/futures/pnl.py;
- test boundary: tests/contracts/pnl_contract_test.py;
- CI boundary: .github/workflows/phase1-domain-contracts.yml;
- meaningful tests, CI enforcement, and same-SHA evidence are mandatory before the cursor advances;
- no threshold reduction, test weakening, skip/xfail, guessed exchange behavior, or dependency-boundary weakening is permitted.

## Phase 1 PnL closure evidence

Realized PnL and unrealized PnL semantics are COMPLETE on main merge SHA `70f319231a758768e18eb951383aa17ed1fe080f`.

Evidence on the exact merge SHA:
- production boundary: `contracts/futures/pnl.py`;
- test boundary: `tests/contracts/pnl_contract_test.py`;
- export boundary: `contracts/futures/__init__.py`;
- Phase 1 Domain Contracts CI: green;
- Architecture Invariants CI: green;
- G01 Dependency Architecture CI: green.

The frozen contract explicitly separates realized closing/offset PnL from unrealized valuation PnL, preserves Linear QUOTE and Inverse BASE denomination, uses explicit LONG/SHORT sign semantics, exact Decimal arithmetic, zero-PnL validity, valuation provenance/freshness, and excludes fees/funding/settlement/accounting from PnL unless explicitly represented by their own contracts. No exchange-specific PnL convention was guessed.

No threshold reduction, test weakening, skip/xfail, guessed exchange behavior, or dependency-boundary weakening was used.

The next authorized Phase 1 unit is **exposure and position valuation semantics**.

## Phase 1 next-unit semantic gate — exposure and position valuation

Before implementation, the next unit must freeze one explicit owner and define:
1. exposure versus valuation meaning and lifecycle boundary;
2. required position inputs, quantities, prices, multipliers, outputs, units, and denominations;
3. Linear/Inverse formulas without collapsing their financial meaning;
4. CRYPTO/FOREX/GOLD applicability;
5. interaction with instrument, multiplier, settlement, margin, leverage, price/quantity, funding, PnL, position side/mode, and accounting without redefining them;
6. exact numeric representation and precision/rounding behavior;
7. reference-price provenance and freshness where valuation is used;
8. invalid, missing, stale, contradictory, unsupported, or ambiguous state behavior;
9. allowed and forbidden dependencies;
10. meaningful tests and CI enforcement;
11. same-SHA evidence before the cursor advances.

No exchange-specific exposure, mark-price, valuation, rounding, fee, or accounting default may be guessed into the canonical contract.
